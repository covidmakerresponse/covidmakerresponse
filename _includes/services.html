                    <p>Every year around early to mid-November, FLIP holds distribution day to provide warm coats to students for whom buying such clothing would present a financial difficulty. For students who cannot make it to distribution day, FLIP does set up appointments to come try on and take a coat.</p>
                    <p>We accept donations for new or lightly used winter-wear beginning around the start of October. What we do not reach in donations, we make sure to go out and buy extra coats so there is never any shortage.</p>
