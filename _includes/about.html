CMR was founded by <a href="https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/2020/03/21/studio-librarians-face-shields/">librarians at Columbia University Libraries</a> and <a href="https://tangiblecreative.com/">Tangible Creative Inc.</a> and has progressed quickly to include <a href="https://www.makerbot.com/">MakerBot</a> and a growing list of service providers. The goal of CMR is to join the growing movement of coalitions working to manufacture, assemble, and distribute 3D printed parts to Hospitals in the NYC area as efficiently as possibleâ€”including so far, Columbia Presbyterian, Mount Sinai, Bronx Lebanon and St. Charles.</p>
