CMR was founded by <a href="https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/2020/03/21/studio-librarians-face-shields/">librarians at Columbia University Libraries</a> and <a href="https://tangiblecreative.com/">Tangible Creative</a>, and it has progressed quickly to include <a href="https://www.makerbot.com/">MakerBot</a> and a growing list of service providers. The goal of CMR is to join the growing movement of coalitions working to manufacture, assemble, and distribute 3D printed parts to hospitals in the NYC area as efficiently as possibleâ€”including so far, Columbia Presbyterian, Mount Sinai, Bronx Lebanon, and St. Charles. To learn more about our method and the 3D print model we are using visit our <a href="https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/face-shield/" target="_blank">Guide and Design for Rapidly Produced Face Shields</a>.</p>
